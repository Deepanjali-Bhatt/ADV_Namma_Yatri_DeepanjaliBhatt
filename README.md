# Namma Yatri Data Analysis: Optimizing Operations & Growth

This repository contains the analysis, insights, and strategic recommendations for Namma Yatri, aimed at improving operational efficiency and driving business growth.

## Project Goal

To identify key opportunities to enhance Namma Yatri's service efficiency, reduce trip cancellations, and maximize revenue.

## Key Insights

* **High Cancellation Rates:** Nearly 1 in 2 trips (both customer and driver initiated) are cancelled, highlighting significant friction points.
* **Peak Demand & Revenue Periods:** Morning (8-10 AM) and Evening (6-8 PM) commutes are prime times. "Early Morning" (12-6 AM) surprisingly contributes a substantial 25% of total revenue.
* **High-Impact Zones:** Specific locations like Bangalore South, Yeshwantpur, and Ramanagaram are key drivers of trips and revenue.
* **Digital Payment Preference:** Users show a strong and balanced preference for digital payment methods (Credit Card, Debit Card, UPI) over cash.
* **Conversion Variability:** The overall trip completion rate after quote search is ~68%, but varies significantly by time of day (e.g., higher in "Early Morning," lower at "Night").

## Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Dynamic Driver Management:** Implement targeted incentives to align driver supply with peak demand hours and high-value geographic zones.
2.  **Optimize Customer Journey:** Enhance in-app transparency (fares, ETAs) and streamline the booking process to significantly reduce cancellations and improve conversion rates.
3.  **Targeted Growth & Incentives:** Launch localized marketing campaigns, promote digital payment benefits, and introduce off-peak ridership incentives to drive sustainable growth and foster driver loyalty.
